# About Me

 - 👋 Hi, I’m David. I'm an aspiring Web Developer.
- 🌍 I live in Dublin, Ireland.

- 👨‍🍳 I previously worked in the hospitality industry as a speciality coffee shop manager, and before that a chef until the pandemic upended my situation!
- 🧑‍💻 Suddenly I had time to explore my life long love of technology, and began to learn how to code, starting with Python and then onto HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 🖥️ Currently, I'm an Apprentice Software Engineer at Microsoft working on Android apps.
- 🚅 I love to travel, especially by train!
- 🌱 I try to live as sustainably as possible, and would love to apply tech to solutions for our climate crisis.
